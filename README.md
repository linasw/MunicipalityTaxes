# TaxesMunicipality

## Swagger
This project uses swagger, which you can access via https://localhost:7216/swagger
NOTE: When using the API via Swagger, for some reason, it's taking the date in US format, so MM-dd-YYYY (unless it's my local instance issue only)

## SQLite
For DB, SQLite is being used. This repo has already the .db file commited with the main Copenhagen tax rates as per examples.

## Docker
There's an initial Dockerfile, but it doesn't work... I won't have more time to fix it, so I left it as it is
